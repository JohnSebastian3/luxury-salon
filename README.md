## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a landing page for a Salon Business. It was first built using floats, but then transitioned to flexbox and grid. It is fully responsive, and on mobile there is a working
lookbook carousel to see pictures of clients. 

## Optimizations

Optimizations planned are compressing images and refactoring code to increase load time.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I learned during this project was how to build a functioning carousel using JavaScript. I'm not sure if it's the most efficient, and it was difficult to construct since the 
pictures were of difference dimensions, but I am happy with the end product.
